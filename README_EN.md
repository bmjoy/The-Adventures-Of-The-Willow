# The-Adventures-Of-The-Willow

Hello everyone, welcome in advance!

The game will be open source all who can contribute, modify, distribute the game under the license
GNU General Public License v3.0. Everyone who contributes, and depending on how they do it, will be credited in the game.

Non-profit, which means that it will be resolved as a hobby for me and anyone who wants to
contribute, something similar to the contributions of SuperTux or SuperTuxKart games.

The Adventures Of The Willow game is a game made in Unity Engine using C#, the game is an idea
based on the two sequels to Ori and The Blind Forest and Super Mario.

Using the two together will be based on having objects like Super Mario, but in an open world like the original.
making it look like everything followed with the additive scene, and set against beautiful landscapes.
Having the map to guide you to see the objects and places where the player is, just like the ori or hollow knight.
Each world will have its theme with open worlds, the first one for example will be a forest, this one will have a
cave and two bosses that these are the guardians of the locations, the second will be a desert with tropical and deep sea,
and so on.
The worlds will be separated from each other, making several maps for each one of them.

The game uses audio FMOD (fmod.com) "you can download the software from the original page, not required only for
add effects and more audio", for a 3D Spatial Audio environment, and effects.
The game still contains many bugs, mainly in the enemies when interacting with the player, and in the settings
keyboard changes.
In the android version I notice the game is a bit heavy, so I'm not sure if I'm going to release it for touch devices.


EVERYONE IS WELCOME TO HELP AND IT WILL BE CREDITED IN THE GAME :)
